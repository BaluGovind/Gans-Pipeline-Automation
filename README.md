# Gans-Pipeline-Automation
This projects aims at familiarising the concepts of data scraping, data analysis and automation of functions using AWS platform.
Gans is an E-scooter provider and they have recruited me as a Data Engineer to come up with optimum locations to place their scooters. The Customer services department have gathered that the majority of the users are commuters on flights. 
With that in mind my duties were to gather demographic data of the major airline hubs, analyse the weather forecast, collect flight details and make a database. Then this database would be exported to AWS RDS instance and with the help of Lambda Functions, queries can be modelled and automated.
The findings and essence of this project is distilled into a report in pdf format which could be found in this repository.
